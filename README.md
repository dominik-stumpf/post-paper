## About

Hello! This little side project of mine is a posting platform where you can edit your posts in a vim editor along with a real-time markdown preview.

> While it's usable, the project is in very early stages, lacking performance improvements especially at the editor part.  
> Placeholder blogs were generated by ChatGPT.

## Build commands

**markdown-rs parser**

```bash
cargo add wasm-bindgen
```
